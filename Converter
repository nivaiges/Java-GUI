*   
*  I affirm that this program is entirely my own work  
*  and none of it is the work of any other person. 
* 
*  This program uses the mainFrame class to create a GUI
*  In this GUI you have a couple of things to interact with. 
*  2 combo boxes are used to select currencies 
*  there is a text filed that you can input a money amount
*  there is a button which calculates the currency exchange between each other
*  for example 1 USD would equal 1.29 CAD and so on.
